  <p>
    I'm currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/cse/index.php" target="_blank">Louisiana State University (LSU)</a>, 
      focused at the intersection of software engineering and robotics.   
  </p>
  <p>
     
    My primary interests lie in 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction" target="_blank">Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)</a> 
      and human-machine teams, particularly exploring how we can enable more intuitive and effective collaboration. 
    My recent work focuses on conversational robot programming, 
      investigating how natural language and dialogue can empower users to program robots with greater ease and flexibility.
