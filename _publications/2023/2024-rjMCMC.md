  Modern phylogenetic paleobiology allows for a meaningful synthesis of quantitative paleobiology and phylogenetics. However, in achieving this synthesis, we have opened new frontiers of questions about appropriate model choice. In this manuscript, we explore the idea of incorporating model uncertainty in phylogenetic estimation with reversible jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC). Using a previously-published study as a guide, we re-evaluate the strength of evidence for subcomponents of the Fossilized Birth-Death (FBD) process, implemented as a joint model. Using a combination of simulations and an empirical dataset of Cambrian echinoderms, the Cincta, we explore the performance and implications of rjMCMC applied to paleobiological data. Our results highlight the advantages of integrating over multiple sources of uncertainty when making phylogenetic inferences from fossil data, and provide a framework for quantifying the full range of alternative evolutionary scenarios.
