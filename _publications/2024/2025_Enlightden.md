  With the help of federal student aid, higher education has become
more financially attainable, allowing more students than ever the oppor-
tunity for economic upward mobility. However, while financial access to
higher education may be improving, there is still a systemic void of sup-
port for learners of disadvantaged backgrounds, including students who
can be described as: nontraditional, low socio-economic status, or hav-
ing certain learning disabilities. These students often lack study skills,
educational support (i.e. tutoring), and expendable time to dedicate to
school due to time consuming responsibilities (i.e. maintaining a job to
financially support oneself and/or multiple dependents). These observa-
tions in tandem with the alarming situation in the United States that
involves a decline in reading literacy and math skills raise concerns about
having to deal with an emerging national security issue and a situation
that may limit the growth of the US economy in the future. EnlightDen
uses AI to provide a personalized learning experience that addresses gaps
in a studentâ€™s academic support system by focusing on individual needs.
